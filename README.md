# End2End_SDSCM
End2End-SDSCM is an end-to-end extension of the Sequence-Driven Structural Causal Models (SD-SCM) framework. It enables users to generate observational, interventional, and counterfactual datasets with minimal manual input, requiring only a causal graph and a small set of high-level prompts.
